# Contributing

Hello! Thanks for your interest in contributing to this project. 🐰 💕

We welcome issues being submitted for bugs or small tweaks in existing extensions, but not requests or contributions for new extensions.

Similarly, community contributions (Pull Requests) are welcome for small enhancements and bug fixes. Please make sure your contributions follow our standard [Pull Request Process](https://docs.directus.io/contributing/pull-request-process). This requires an issue being submitted and triaged before a PR can be opened for review.

## Getting Started

A couple of important notes before continuing:

* Please see our docs on [how to publish an extension to the Marketplace](//docs.directus.io/extensions/marketplace/publishing.html) if you would like to publish your own extension
* You will need to review the [Contributor License Agreement](https://github.com/directus-labs/extensions/blob/main/cla.md) (CLA) for this project and sign it by adding your GitHub username to [the contributors.yml file](https://github.com/directus-labs/extensions/blob/main/contributors.yml) in your first Pull Request
  * If you have contributed to the core [@directus/directus](https://github.com/directus/directus) project before, the CLA is the same for both projects
* Any Pull Request that is opened without a relevant approved issue will be closed without further comment
* All contributors are subject to our [Code of Conduct](https://docs.directus.io/contributing/code-of-conduct.html)

There are plenty of other ways to contribute to the Directus project as well if you'd like to help. Please see our [contributing guidelines](https://docs.directus.io/contributing/introduction) to learn more.
