## Usage

Once installed and configured, all included fields will show the comment icon next to the field label to identify which fields can accept comments. A badge will appear on this icon when comments have been left for that field.

Click on this icon to open the comments feed where you can read through the comments or leave a new comment of you own. You can use the @ symbol to tag and notify other users and also use emojis.

_Please note, comments do not appear when creating a new item. It must be saved first, before comments can be added._
