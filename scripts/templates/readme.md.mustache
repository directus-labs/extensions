## üê∞ &nbsp;Introduction

This repository is for our extensions published under the Directus Labs program. Unlike the core [@directus/directus](https://github.com/directus/directus) project, extensions here may not be actively developed after their initial release unless they are indicated as maintained in the table below.

## üì¶ &nbsp;Extensions

The extensions in this repository are all published to the Directus Marketplace.

Some of the published extensions may not be compatible with the sandbox requirements currently, and are only available on Directus instances with the `MARKETPLACE_TRUST` env set to `all`.
